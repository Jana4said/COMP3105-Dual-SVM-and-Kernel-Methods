# Dual SVM and Kernel Methods (COMP 3105)


A **Machine Learning project** that implements the **dual form of Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and explores different **kernel functions** to classify MNIST digits (4 vs 9).  
This project demonstrates how to apply convex optimization and kernel-based learning techniques to real-world data.

## Features 
- Implements **dual-form SVM** using `cvxopt`  
- Supports multiple **kernel functions**: Linear, Polynomial, Gaussian  
- Performs **cross-validation** for Î» (regularization parameter) selection  
- Compares model performance across different kernels  
- Includes reproducible setup via `requirements.txt`

## Core Concepts 
- Dual formulation of SVM  
- Kernel methods (Polynomial & Gaussian)  
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Model evaluation and analysis  
- Application to real dataset (MNIST 4 vs 9)

## How It Works
1. Loads MNIST subset for digits 4 and 9.  
2. Trains SVM models using different kernels (Linear, Polynomial, Gaussian).  
3. Uses cross-validation to select the best Î» and kernel parameters.  
4. Evaluates model accuracy and compares results in a summary table.  
5. Presents conclusions and visual results in the report.
